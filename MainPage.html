				<p>We have made it our mission to give our guests the excellent coffee and dining experience they
					deserve!
					You work hard every day and that warrants nothing less than the perfect cup of coffee or specialty
					drink
					to get you to your next goal.</p>

				<p>All of our coffees are sourced from Panache Coffee Roasters, a roaster we personally know and love.
					We
					source from Panache because of their farmer-focused approach and commitment to sustainability. Not
					only
					does their mission and ethics align with ours but the coffee itself is something special. Panache
					offers
					a variety of flavor profiles that can fit any mood and accommodate every kind of customer. From dark
					and
					nutty to light, bright, and fruity, Panache has it all!</p>

				<p>Each morning you can find one of our wonderful bakers thoughtfully crafting our daily selections,
					that
					is if you get here early enough! Having our own in-house bakery helps to ensure our guests are
					getting
					the freshest and tastiest treats. Choose from our fresh selection of pastries, cookies, and egg and
					cheese breakfast croissants and so much more! There’s something for everyone!</p>

				<p>We want you to have the best experience you can have, try new things, and have a great time doing it.
					If
					you have questions, we’ve got answers. If you try something new and it’s not your thing, that’s
					cool,
					we’ll make you something else (free of charge, of course). Galazia Coffee hasn’t been around for
					over
					30 years for nothing! We want to do the best we can, and the proof is in the pudding!</p>
